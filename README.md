# AuroraJS
An aurora/solar data aggregator running on NodeJS

## Purpose
This small NodeJS application will gather several sources from SWPC/NOAA and format a single filtered json output.

Main (personal) use is to integrate with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) but it can be used for other applications you may have in mind.

## Installation
Clone or download this repository to a local directory and navigate into the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wlouckx/aurorajs.git
cd aurorajs/
```
### Option 1: Node (no containers)
Simply run the project as it is not dependent on any non-standard node packages. Make sure you have [installed NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) on your system:
```shell
node ./main.js
```
### Option 2: Docker
Build the docker image:
```shell
docker build -t aurorajs:alpine .
```
Run the docker image as container:
```shell
docker run --name aurorajs2 -p 8080:8080 -d aurorajs:alpine
```
## Use
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the output.

See more about the contents of the JSON output below.

## Configuration
**Note: For all configuration changes, you will have to restart your Nodejs server, or in case of docker, rebuild your container.**
### main.js
You can modify the following constants to change the port and ip the node server will listen on:
```js
const PORT = 8080;
const HOST = '0.0.0.0';
```
**Note:** When running in a container, also change the `Dockerfile` line `EXPOSE 8080` to the corresponding port, and the mapping in the docker run command.

### parser.js
Here is where the magic happens. To include the original source files, you can uncomment the lines:
```js
// "original" : body
```
Including the original content increases the load time and size of the output.

## Home Assistant
Included you can find a Home Assistant configuration example (`home-assitant.yaml`). Copy the contents of this file into your `configuration.yaml`.
### Home Assistant Core
If you have Home Assistant Core (running home-assistant in your own container), you can spin up AuroraJS in a container in the same docker network as Home Assistant. An example for a docker-compose file with an existing docker network `proxy_bridge`:
```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  home-assistant:
    image: homeassistant/home-assistant:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - "8123"
    volumes:
      - /home/user/homeassistant/config:/config
    networks:
      - proxy_bridge
  aurorajs:
    image: aurorajs:alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - "8080"
    networks:
      - proxy_bridge

networks:
  proxy_bridge:
    external:
      name: proxy_bridge
```
**Note:** Adapt this to your own configuration (reverse-proxy, exposing/mapping ports, etc..)

### Full Home Assistant:
I am currently looking into making this a package for Home Assistant. However I feel, as there already is a Aurora integration, that one should be expanded with more attributes instead of running my setup.

If you want to be creative, you can spin up a nodejs server and try to reach it from within home assistant.

## How it works and Data example
There is not much rocket science going on in the script. Basicly this happens:
* Each function first checks if it needs an update. Default 300 seconds, some use 60 seconds.
* If an update is needed, it fetches the data from SWPC/NOAA.
* It transforms the data and puts it in a self defined standard, and attaches it to the `content` property.
* If no data was found, the `values` property returns empty `{}`.
* All functions are called asynchronous and in parallel to spead up the generation of the output.
* The results may vary in order, depending on which retreive was faster than the other.

Here is an example output of the data with explanatory comments:
```jsonc

    "name": "SWPC NOAA Info",                                       // standard info
